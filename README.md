Reshape of the list of VOEC registered foreign sellers into a more user friendly webapp in Python

The actual version (v1.0)is a MVP and uses manual ingest of the pdf to generate the database and basic Pandas functions

V1.1: 
Update to the november version
possible now to search by company
known issue of double display when both country and compnany are selected, refresh help ;-)
To Do:
- automatise the update of the data (update every month I think) with auto download of the pdf with beautiful/camelot
- remove the index when display the df
- turn the url to clickable link
- make button to download list as pdf/excel......
- figure:  number of  sellers per country on the main page
- map with clickable country?

V1.2: 
The list is now available as a CSV file which is way easier to handle than digesting a PDF file!! 
Update of the list of company with the lastest version of 12.08.21
